# sorting-visualizer
Shows sets of randomly generated integers being sorted by various algorithms. This is a fun side project that I spent some free time working on. Visually, it has reached a point that I am happy with. Code wise, it is now set up in such a way that I can easily incorporate more sorting algorithms as I learn them in later classes. For now I'll be focusing primarily on different projects and adding more sorting algorithms to this project as I learn them.
